# Makerspace-website
---

Welcome to the Maker Space Website Github! Here you'll have access to and can modify all the files of the website. 
-
What we need:
--
- Content!! (there is a lot of info which we need to add!)
- Photos!!
- Add parts to the website!! (I have a skeleton done for which parts might go where but change it as you see fit!)

Some things to keep in mind:
--
- The U of I has certain style rules such as colors that we can use: https://brand.illinois.edu/visual-identity/color#:~:text=Our%20Illini%20Orange%20and%20Illini,led%20to%20this%20specific%20palette.

- Text can only be Open Sans Pro (which I believe is already set on the html but can be modified
- Andrew has access to headers and footers + any other requirements which we will be able to fix once we transfer the files over

THANK YOU!
